silkbd
======

Pronounced “silk-board” or “silk-keyboard” or “SIL keyboard”. Whatever you
want, really.

In order to install, download `Xmodmap.silkbd` and put it in your home
directory, preferably as `.Xmodmap.silkbd` and symlink `.Xmodmap` to it:

```
ln -s .Xmodmap.silkbd .Xmodmap
```

You only have to do that command once. Then you only need to redownload
the `Xmodmap.silkbd` file and save it over `.Xmodmap.silkbd`.
